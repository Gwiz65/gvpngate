  "body": "\r\n Overview:\r\n===========\r\nGvpngate is a VPN Gate frontend for Gnome Network Manager.  Gvpngate will will create OpenVPN connection entries based on the vpn list provided by the VPN Gate project.  For more information concerning the VPN Gate project please visit http://www.vpngate.net.  Valid connections will remain in Gnome Network Manager, even after Gvpngate is closed.  To remove connections created by Gvpngate, use Gnome's Network Settings dialog.  Gvpngate is not required to be running to use the created connections.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n Gpvngate In Action\r\n====================\r\n\r\n![Gvpngate in Action](Gvpngate in action.png)\r\nGvpngate after vpn list has loaded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Gvpngate with Gnome Network Manager.png](Gvpngate with Gnome Network Manager.png)\r\nGvpngate with Gnome Network Manager showing connections\r\n\r\n\r\n Runtime Requirements\t\t\r\n======================\r\nRequired Debian packages or your distro equivalent:\r\n\r\n    network_manager_openvpn_gnome\r\n    wget\r\n\r\n\t\r\n Installation\r\n==============\r\nUnzip to a directory and 'cd' to that directory and type:\r\n\r\n    'autoreconf -i --force'\r\n    './configure'\r\n    'make'\r\n\r\nAs root type:\r\n\r\n    'make install'\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, as root type:\r\n\r\n    'make uninstall'\r\n\r\nRun (as regular user) by typing:\r\n\r\n    'gvpngate'\r\nor by selecting Gvpngate from the Applications->Internet menu\r\n\r\n\r\n Using Gvpngate\r\n================\r\nUsage of Gvpngate is very straightforward. After the vpn list loads select a\r\nvpn from the list and create a Gnome Network Manager connection by selecting \r\n\"Connect\" from the menubar, pushing the \"Connect\" button or by double-clicking \r\non an entry in the vpn list.  Gvpngate will create the connection and attempt \r\nto connect to it. If the connection fails, Gvpngate will remove the connection \r\nfrom Gnome Network Manager. If the connection succeeds, the connection will \r\nremain available in Gnome Network Manager, even after Gvpngate is closed. To\r\nrefresh the vpn list, select \"Refresh\" from the menubar or push the \"Refresh\"\r\nbutton. If downloading of the vpn list fails, Gvpngate will attempt to use a\r\npreviously downloaded vpn list.\r\n\r\n\r\n Certificate Files\r\n===================\r\nThe CA Certificate files for the created vpn connections are stored in a \r\ndirectory named \".gvpngate\" in the current user's home directory.  While\r\nGvpngate need not be running to access the created connections, access to\r\nthe \".gvpngate\" directory is required.  Gvpngate deletes any unused \r\ncertificate files on shutdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n A note about IPv6\r\n===================\r\nThe VPN Gate servers do not appear to support IPv6 at this time and as a\r\nresult neither does Gvpngate.  To avoid leaking your IPv6 address and/or your \r\nIPv6 DNS inquiries, I suggest following the recomendations at\r\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/DebianIPv6#How_to_turn_off_IPv6 for Debian or a \r\nsimilar work-around for your distro.\r\n\r\n\r\nGvpngate was created and tested on the following system:\r\n\r\n     Linux Kernel:\t3.2.0-4-amd64\r\n           Distro:\tDebian GNU/Linux 7.9 (wheezy)\r\n    Gnome Version:\t3.4.2\r\n\r\n",
