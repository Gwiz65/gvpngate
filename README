 Overview:
===========
Gvpngate is a VPN Gate frontend for Gnome Network Manager.  Gvpngate will
will create OpenVPN connection entries based on the vpn list provided by
the VPN Gate project.  For more information concerning the VPN Gate project		
please visit http://www.vpngate.net.  Valid connections will remain in 
Gnome Network Manager, even after Gvpngate is closed.  To remove connections
created by Gvpngate, use Gnome's Network Settings dialog.  Gvpngate is not
required to be running to use the created connections.

	
 Runtime Requirements		
======================
Required Debian packages or your distro equivalent:

	 - network_manager_openvpn_gnome
	 - wget

	
 Installation
==============
Unzip to a directory and 'cd' to that directory and type:
	'autoreconf -i --force'
	'./configure'
	'make'
As root type:
	'make install'

To uninstall, as root type:
	'make uninstall'

Run (as regular user) by typing: 'gvpngate'
	or by selecting Gvpngate from the Applications->Internet menu


 Using Gvpngate
================
Usage of Gvpngate is very straightforward. After the vpn list loads select a
vpn from the list and create a Gnome Network Manager connection by selecting 
"Connect" from the menubar, pushing the "Connect" button or by double-clicking 
on an entry in the vpn list.  Gvpngate will create the connection and attempt 
to connect to it. If the connection fails, Gvpngate will remove the connection 
from Gnome Network Manager. If the connection succeeds, the connection will 
remain available in Gnome Network Manager, even after Gvpngate is closed. To
refresh the vpn list, select "Refresh" from the menubar or push the "Refresh"
button. If downloading of the vpn list fails, Gvpngate will attempt to use a
previously downloaded vpn list.


 Certificate Files
===================
The CA Certificate files for the created vpn connections are stored in a 
directory named ".gvpngate" in the current user's home directory.  While
Gvpngate need not be running to access the created connections, access to
the ".gvpngate" directory is required.  Gvpngate deletes any unused 
certificate files on shutdown.


 A note about IPv6
===================
The VPN Gate servers do not appear to support IPv6 at this time and as a
result neither does Gvpngate.  To avoid leaking your IPv6 address and/or your 
IPv6 DNS inquiries, I suggest following the recomendations at
https://wiki.debian.org/DebianIPv6#How_to_turn_off_IPv6 for Debian or a 
similar work-around for your distro.


Gvpngate was created and tested on the following system:
	 Linux Kernel:	3.2.0-4-amd64
	       Distro:	Debian GNU/Linux 7.9 (wheezy)
	Gnome Version:	3.4.2
